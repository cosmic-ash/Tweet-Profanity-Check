# Tweet-Profanity-Check

#Python code to indicate the profanity of tweets saved in a single file.

The tweets are saved in a single text file, with each tweet on a new line. The tweets file is opened and each tweet is read into a list. The tweets in the list are tokenized and are later checked with a list containing racial slurs. If a match is detected, based on count of profanities tokens, profanity degree of a particular tweet is calculated.
